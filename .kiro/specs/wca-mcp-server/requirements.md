# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms AI assistants into knowledgeable speedcubing experts by providing comprehensive access to World Cube Association (WCA) data. The MCP server will enable AI assistants to answer complex questions about speedcubing, provide current world records, analyze competitor performance, track competition trends, and offer insights into the global speedcubing community.

Rather than just providing raw API access, this MCP server will give AI assistants the knowledge and context to engage meaningfully with speedcubing enthusiasts, help newcomers understand the sport, provide up-to-date competitive information, and serve as a comprehensive speedcubing knowledge base that can answer questions ranging from "What's the current 3x3 world record?" to "How has speedcubing evolved in different countries over the past decade?"
